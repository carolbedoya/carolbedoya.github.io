# Hola!

I am a bioacoustician/acoustic ecologist (PhD). I develop computational/signal processing tools for the analysis of acoustic data and use
them to solve biologically-relevant issues. My areas of expertise are Computational Intelligence (Artificial Neural Networks/Deep Learning, Clustering
Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary Computation) and Animal Acoustics (Bioacoustics,Ecoacoustics, and Biotremology). 

Languages: Matlab/Python/C++
